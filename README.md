# Hypothesis-Testing

For Doing Hypothesis testing we used:
1. Shapiro test
2. Chi Square test

Here main motive is to find "p value"
p value > 0.05   =  Null Hypothesis Passed
p value <= 0.05  =  Null Hypothesis Rejected

Task 1:
A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.

Task 2:
A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch. Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.

Task 3:
Sales of products in four different regions is tabulated for males and females. Find if male-female buyer rations are similar across regions. East West North South.

Task 4:
Telecall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain % of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and must be reworked before processing. The manager wants to check whether the defective % varies by center. Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences

Task 5:
Fantaloons Sales managers commented that % of males versus females walking into the store differ based on day of the week. Analyze the data and determine whether there is evidence at 5 % significance level to support this hypothesis.
